# Plan: Restore Real Projects & Update Site Title

## Summary

The most recent UI overhaul (commit `e07d66b`) replaced the real projects with hallucinated ones. This plan restores the original 5 projects and updates the site title from "MCGEOCITY" to "alexmccune.dev".

---

## Problem Analysis

### Hallucinated Projects (Current - Need to Remove)
1. **Gather** - Not a real project
2. **Betrayal** - Exists but oversimplified
3. **Gamba** - Not a real project
4. **Resume Tailor** - Not a real project
5. **McGeocity** - Self-referential (keep or remove?)

### Real Projects (From Commit `c9b2a75` - Need to Restore)
1. **Matrix Miles** - Go/CircuitPython IoT + Strava LED matrix display
2. **Betrayal Discord Bot** - Go Discord bot for social deduction game
3. **Eggbert** - Godot RPG game (C#/GDScript)
4. **Twitter Bot Little_T** - Python ML Twitter bot with Markov chains
5. **Kusa Data** - TypeScript Smash Bros tournament finder
6. **McGeocity** - Keep this one (the portfolio website itself)

---

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Replace Projects Data (`src/routes/projects/+page.svelte`)

Replace the current `projects` array (lines 8-44) with the restored real projects, adapting the data structure to match the current industrial UI format:

```typescript
const projects = [
  {
    name: "Matrix Miles",
    description: "IoT project bridging fitness data with embedded hardware. Go backend with Strava OAuth, PostgreSQL, and REST API. Embedded client on MatrixPortal M4 with CircuitPython displaying running stats on LED matrix.",
    tech: "Go, CircuitPython, PostgreSQL, Docker, Strava API",
    demo: "https://matrix-miles-production.up.railway.app",
    code: "https://github.com/McCune1224/matrix-miles"
  },
  {
    name: "Betrayal Discord Bot",
    description: "Comprehensive Discord bot for managing Betrayal, a battle royale social deduction game. Features structured logging, async PostgreSQL batch writes, command audit trails, and dynamic channel management.",
    tech: "Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, Discord API",
    demo: "https://github.com/McCune1224/betrayal",
    code: "https://github.com/McCune1224/betrayal"
  },
  {
    name: "Eggbert",
    description: "RPG game in Godot where you play as Eggbert, an egg falsely accused of a crime. Journey through a prison system to escape and uncover secrets.",
    tech: "Godot, C#, Pixel Art",
    demo: "https://github.com/McCune1224/eggbert",
    code: "https://github.com/McCune1224/eggbert"
  },
  {
    name: "Little_T Twitter Bot",
    description: "Machine Learning bot using Markov Chains, deployed via AWS Lambda. Real-time Twitter interaction using Twitter Account Activity API and Tweepy.",
    tech: "Python, AWS Lambda, MongoDB, Twitter API",
    demo: "https://x.com/little_t_bot",
    code: "https://github.com/McCune1224/little-t"
  },
  {
    name: "Kusa Data",
    description: "Web app using Start.gg GraphQL API to find Smash Bros Ultimate tournaments. Redis caching for optimal response times, player profile viewing with tournament history.",
    tech: "TypeScript, Redis, GraphQL, Start.gg API",
    demo: "https://kusa-data.vercel.app/",
    code: "https://github.com/McCune1224/kusa-data"
  },
  {
    name: "McGeocity",
    description: "This website! Personal portfolio with Half-Life industrial aesthetic.",
    tech: "SvelteKit, TypeScript, TailwindCSS",
    demo: "https://mcgeocity.vercel.app",
    code: "https://github.com/mccune1224/McGeocity"
  }
];
```

### 2. Update Site Title (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`)

**Line 31:** Change `title="MCGEOCITY"` to `title="alexmccune.dev"`

**Line 47:** Update footer text from `MCGEOCITY // HALF-LIFE AESTHETIC // 2026` to `alexmccune.dev // HALF-LIFE AESTHETIC // 2026`

---

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/routes/projects/+page.svelte` | Replace projects array with real projects (lines 8-44) |
| `src/routes/+layout.svelte` | Update title prop (line 31) and footer text (line 47) |

---

## Verification

1. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
2. Navigate to `/projects` page and verify:
   - 5 real projects displayed (Matrix Miles, Betrayal, Eggbert, Little_T, Kusa Data)
   - Project descriptions match original data
   - Demo/Code links work correctly
3. Verify navbar shows "alexmccune.dev" instead of "MCGEOCITY"
4. Verify footer shows updated site name
5. Run `npm run check` to ensure no TypeScript errors
6. Run `npm run build` to verify production build succeeds
7. Get user approval before pushing to production
